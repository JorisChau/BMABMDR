\usage{
samplingQ_MA(
  data.Q,
  prior.weights,
  ndraws = 30000,
  nrchains = 3,
  nriterations = 5000,
  warmup = 1000,
  delta = 0.8,
  treedepth = 10,
  seed = 123,
  pvec = c(0.025, 0.5, 0.975)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{prior.weights}{a vector specifying which of the 16 models should be included (1 = include, 0 = exclude)}

\item{ndraws}{the number of draws from the posterior, default 30000}

\item{nrchains}{the number of chains to be used in the MCMC}

\item{nriterations}{the number of iterations per chain}

\item{warmup}{the number of iterations per chain to be discarded as burnin}

\item{delta}{default 0.8}

\item{treedepth}{default 10}

\item{seed}{default 123}

\item{pvec}{vector specifying the three BMD quantiles of interest}

\item{data.N}{the input data as returned by function PREP_DATA_N}

\item{data.LN}{the input data as returned by function PREP_DATA_LN}

\item{plot}{logical indicating whether a simple plot of model fits should be shown (defaults to FALSE)}
}
\value{
List with the model-specific results, model weights, the model averaged BMD, BMDL and BMDU. In addition for each model a matrix with covariance/correlation between parameter b/BMD and parameter d is given. Some additional output used in other external functions is also given.
}

This method assumed data for continuous endpoints.
